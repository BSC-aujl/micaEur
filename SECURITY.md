# Security Policy & DORA Compliance

This document outlines our approach to security and compliance with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) for the MiCA EUR stablecoin.

## DORA Cyber-Resilience Framework

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) requires financial entities to have a robust ICT risk management framework. Our MiCA EUR stablecoin implements the following DORA-aligned controls:

### 1. ICT Risk Management

- **Risk Assessment**: Regular assessment of smart contract and infrastructure vulnerabilities
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of transaction patterns for anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Clear protocols for responding to security incidents
- **Change Management**: Strict process for code changes and deployments

### 2. Third-Party Risk Management

- **Veriff Integration**: Secure KYC provider with GDPR compliance
- **Banking API Monitoring**: Regular assessment of PSD2 API security
- **Vendor Assessments**: Routine security assessments of all integration points

### 3. ICT-Related Incident Management

#### Incident Response Protocol

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts for suspicious activities
2. **Classification**: Severity-based classification system for incidents
3. **Containment**: Ability to freeze accounts and pause minting
4. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis of security incidents
5. **Recovery**: Procedures for normalizing operations post-incident
6. **Reporting**: BaFin notification protocols for major incidents

### 4. Digital Operational Resilience Testing

#### Security Testing Program

- **Smart Contract Audits**: External audits before mainnet deployment
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular testing of API endpoints
- **Scenario Testing**: Simulations of major disruptions
- **War Gaming**: Regular exercises of incident response procedures

### 5. Information Sharing

- **Threat Intelligence**: Participation in financial sector threat sharing
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Procedures for incident reporting to BaFin
- **Transparency Reports**: Regular public disclosure of security metrics

## Technical Resilience Measures

### Smart Contract Security

- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions are formally verified
- **Access Controls**: Multi-layered permission system
- **Rate Limiting**: Transaction rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pausing on unusual activity

### Infrastructure Resilience

- **Validator Redundancy**: Connection to multiple Solana validators
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatic failover for API services
- **Backup RPC Endpoints**: Multiple RPC endpoints for resilience
- **Cold Storage**: Reserve funds managed in cold storage
- **Multi-signature Controls**: Admin operations require multiple approvals

### Data Protection

- **Privacy by Design**: GDPR-compliant data handling
- **Minimized On-chain Data**: Only necessary data stored on-chain
- **Hashed Identifiers**: User identifiers are securely hashed
- **Encrypted Storage**: All off-chain data is encrypted at rest

## Backup and Recovery

### Operational Continuity

1. **Node Redundancy**: Connecting to multiple Solana validators
2. **Database Backups**: Hourly backups of all off-chain data
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures
4. **Alternate Processing Sites**: Geographically distributed infrastructure

## BaFin Regulatory Compliance

- **Â§ 12 ZAG Integration**: Native support for freeze and seizure orders
- **MiCA Article 51 Disclosures**: Available in whitepaper
- **Transaction Monitoring**: AML pattern detection
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated suspicious activity reports
