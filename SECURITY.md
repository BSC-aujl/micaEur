# Security Policy

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the MiCA EUR stablecoin.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MiCA EUR team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create it, affected versions, and if known, mitigations. Our security team will respond within 24 hours.

We request that you:
- Allow us time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it to the public
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or revealing it to others
- Provide sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability

## Security Measures

The MiCA EUR stablecoin implements several security measures:

### Access Control

- Strict permission management for critical actions
- Role-based access control for administrative operations
- Multi-signature authorization for high-value operations

### Secure Development

- Comprehensive code reviews before deployment
- Continuous integration with security scanning
- Regular third-party security audits

### Operational Security

- Regular updates to address potential vulnerabilities
- Monitoring systems for suspicious activity
- Incident response procedures

### Smart Contract Security

- Formal verification for critical components
- Program Design with defense-in-depth principles
- Circuit breakers and rate limiting

## Security Features

The MiCA EUR stablecoin includes the following security features:

### Token Freeze

The stablecoin supports account freezing capabilities required by MiCA regulations:

```rust
pub fn freeze_account(ctx: Context<FreezeAccount>) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### Token Seizure

For regulatory compliance, the stablecoin includes token seizure functionality:

```rust
pub fn seize_tokens(ctx: Context<SeizeTokens>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### Blacklisting

The AML system includes blacklisting capabilities:

```rust
pub fn create_blacklist_entry(ctx: Context<CreateBlacklistEntry>, reason: u8) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation details
}
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

The following is our security disclosure timeline:

1. Security report received and assigned a primary handler
2. Problem confirmed and list of affected versions determined
3. Code audit to find any similar problems
4. Develop fixes for all affected versions
5. Notify affected users under embargo
6. Release fixes and update public documentation

## Supported Versions

Security updates will be applied to the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Audits

Security audits are regularly conducted by third-party firms. Audit reports will be published at [audits.example.com](https://audits.example.com) after remediation of any discovered issues.

## DORA Cyber-Resilience Framework

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) requires financial entities to have a robust ICT risk management framework. Our MiCA EUR stablecoin implements the following DORA-aligned controls:

### 1. ICT Risk Management

- **Risk Assessment**: Regular assessment of smart contract and infrastructure vulnerabilities
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of transaction patterns for anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Clear protocols for responding to security incidents
- **Change Management**: Strict process for code changes and deployments

### 2. Third-Party Risk Management

- **Veriff Integration**: Secure KYC provider with GDPR compliance
- **Banking API Monitoring**: Regular assessment of PSD2 API security
- **Vendor Assessments**: Routine security assessments of all integration points

### 3. ICT-Related Incident Management

#### Incident Response Protocol

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts for suspicious activities
2. **Classification**: Severity-based classification system for incidents
3. **Containment**: Ability to freeze accounts and pause minting
4. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis of security incidents
5. **Recovery**: Procedures for normalizing operations post-incident
6. **Reporting**: BaFin notification protocols for major incidents

### 4. Digital Operational Resilience Testing

#### Security Testing Program

- **Smart Contract Audits**: External audits before mainnet deployment
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular testing of API endpoints
- **Scenario Testing**: Simulations of major disruptions
- **War Gaming**: Regular exercises of incident response procedures

### 5. Information Sharing

- **Threat Intelligence**: Participation in financial sector threat sharing
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Procedures for incident reporting to BaFin
- **Transparency Reports**: Regular public disclosure of security metrics

## Technical Resilience Measures

### Smart Contract Security

- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions are formally verified
- **Access Controls**: Multi-layered permission system
- **Rate Limiting**: Transaction rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pausing on unusual activity

### Infrastructure Resilience

- **Validator Redundancy**: Connection to multiple Solana validators
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatic failover for API services
- **Backup RPC Endpoints**: Multiple RPC endpoints for resilience
- **Cold Storage**: Reserve funds managed in cold storage
- **Multi-signature Controls**: Admin operations require multiple approvals

### Data Protection

- **Privacy by Design**: GDPR-compliant data handling
- **Minimized On-chain Data**: Only necessary data stored on-chain
- **Hashed Identifiers**: User identifiers are securely hashed
- **Encrypted Storage**: All off-chain data is encrypted at rest

## Backup and Recovery

### Operational Continuity

1. **Node Redundancy**: Connecting to multiple Solana validators
2. **Database Backups**: Hourly backups of all off-chain data
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures
4. **Alternate Processing Sites**: Geographically distributed infrastructure

## BaFin Regulatory Compliance

- **Â§ 12 ZAG Integration**: Native support for freeze and seizure orders
- **MiCA Article 51 Disclosures**: Available in whitepaper
- **Transaction Monitoring**: AML pattern detection
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated suspicious activity reports
