# MiCA EUR Project Clean-up Summary

## Documentation Reorganization
- Removed redundant documentation files:
  - `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Content redistributed to component-specific READMEs
  - `docs/testing-guide.md` - Testing information moved to component READMEs
- Updated `docs/README.md` to remove references to deleted files
- Updated main `README.md` to point to component-specific documentation
- Fixed diagram references and image paths across documentation

## Build Script Refinement
- Removed redundant `scripts/build-no-proxy.sh` script
- Updated `package.json` to use `build:fast` script with `./scripts/build.sh --skip-lint`
- Updated `.husky/README.md` to reflect the correct build script usage
- Updated `scripts/README.md` to document the `--skip-lint` option in `build.sh`

## Pre-commit Hooks Improvement
- Ensured pre-commit verification scripts work as expected:
  - `verify-signatures.js` - Checks for proper transaction handling
  - `verify-types.js` - Verifies TypeScript types
  - `verify-kyc-levels.js` - Ensures KYC verification level consistency
- Updated `precommit-update.txt` to reflect the correct build script usage

## Clean-up Script Enhancement
- Ensured `cleanup-unused.sh` properly handles all files that should be removed
- Verified the script archives rather than deletes important configuration files

## Next Steps
1. Verify all components build correctly with the updated scripts
2. Run the test suite to ensure nothing was broken during the cleanup
3. Ensure the pre-commit hooks properly verify code before committing

These changes have resulted in:
- A cleaner repository structure
- More maintainable documentation
- Proper pre-commit verification
- Improved development workflow with clear, centralized component documentation
