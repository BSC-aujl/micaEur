/**
 * Tests for token usage based on KYC rules
 *
 * These tests verify that the token usage rules are enforced correctly:
 * - Basic token ownership and transfer is permitted without KYC except for blacklisted addresses
 * - Token redemption at the issuer requires "User" KYC for individuals or "Business" KYC for companies
 * - DeFi services can require appropriate KYC levels depending on the provider and user
